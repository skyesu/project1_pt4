    <p>This is the (previously) sourceless image associated with the 2019 story concept, "The Backrooms". For many netizens, this famous post and its legacy was their first concrete introduction to the realm of online horror, and the dark depths of internet urban legends known as <b>creepypasta.</b></p>

    <p>While 2019 was quite a while ago (sort of i guess), the history of creepypasta is longer, deeper and more nuanced than many of you might imagine. In the interest of keeping our history relevant, let us start where the more knowledgeable creepypasta connoiseurs are likely very familiar:</p>
    <p>March of 2001. A man named Ted updates his website.</p>

        <div class="symb" style="color:rebeccapurple;">&#10063; &#9998;<span style="float:right;">&#8617; &#8618; &#9776;</span></div>
        <div class="window-doc">
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.angelfire.com/trek/caver/">The Page of Ted</a>, whose story therein is known more colloquially as "Ted the Caver", has been cited in academic analysis of horror literature as being a pioneer of the creepypasta. see it for yourself: do you spot anything special?</p>
        <p>the obvious answer is no. at least, until you read it. <i>all</i> of it. as soon as the modern reader breaches about the 4-page mark (pages here meaning Ted's web pages, ordered numerically as you click through) they can easily predict what the story is here: this man is blogging on his site about a dangerous, probably haunted or monster-ridden cave he insists on exploring with his buddy, and he's probably going to regret it. by the end he will either have gone insane or died. frankly, it's obvious even from the first page Ted introduces himself and his mission: this is the online diary of a now dead man. this site is a tombstone. or, at the very least, we know we should expect something bad.</p>
        <blockquote><mark>"3/23/01</mark></blockquote>
        <blockquote><mark>Due to the overwhelming number of requests I have received to tell about my discoveries and bizarre experiences in a cave not far from my home, I have created this web page. I will outline the events that happened to me during the past few months. Beginning with my journey into a familiar cave in December 2000 and ending... well, it hasn't actually ended yet. I will use my caving journal as the text to tell about my recent experience. I will give them to you as I experienced them, in chronological order.</mark></blockquote>
        <blockquote><mark>If you think these events sound far-fetched, I agree. I would come to the same conclusion had I not experienced them."</mark></blockquote>
        <p>it should come to no surprise to the modern reader (or you, here, reading a summary i wrote in 10 minutes of the whole thing) that there eventually comes a point in Ted's journey where he does not update the site again. bear in mind: this site was being written and updated in real time, on the purported dates, by the author, and was being followed by a real audience, just as might be followed the weekly episode of a TV show, or y'know, an actual blog. Ted's page was a current and ongoing event with a real man behind it, and with no set updating schedule, engrossed readers had no way of knowing whether they'd next hear from him in a day, or a week, or a month.</p>
        <p>Then one day, he wrote promising to report back with his findings in his final adventure through the cave, and they never heard from him again.</p>
        <p>In a masterful Chekov's gun move that foreshadows the uncertain nature of the story's end, Ted had written on the very first page,</p>
        <blockquote><mark>"I will try to finish the site as soon as possible. Check the date on the main page to see when I've made updates."</mark></blockquote>
        <p>Eagle-eyed visitors, in the beginning, will take note that the site was last updated in May of 2001, not 2 months after this first page was written. This state is how the site has remained for almost 25 years now. One could argue it's dead; it would certainly be old enough to have decomposed if it were an organic creature. But isn't this ending bound to feel different now than it did in 2001? Somehow I get the feeling that the longer Ted stays in a Schrödinger-esque limbo, "dead", the longer the story simply drags on. 25 years of waiting feels like part of the ending. When you exit to the front page after reading his final message and see that "last updated" date, it's...something. Certainly not nothing. Certainly not dead, as in gone.<span class="blink">|</span></p>

    <p>i love definitions and neat little categories more than anyone. the definition of creepypasta does not have to be overly nuanced and complicated like so many things are, but it surprisingly is not nearly as specific or niche as it sounds. you've probably read creepypasta, or at least seen pictures of one. and if you have only heard one thing about creepypasta, it was probably the real life crime that happened related to slenderman that i won't be delving into on this site because i'm tired. shelf that away for now.</p>
    <blockquote><i>creepypasta:</i> horror content that is delivered wholly or partially through the internet.</blockquote>
    <p>is that broad enough for you? the origin of the word itself is more niche and amusing than a quaint little sentence summarizing the breadth of what it's become. a copypasta is a piece of text that is frequently spread online via copying and pasting (hence, copy-past-a), and as a very forthright portmanteau, creepypasta is exactly what it sounds like: a creepy copypasta. at least, that's what the word meant at first. but the internet is capable of so much more than just displaying text. it didn't even take long for the definition to start shifting: images were integrated into creepypasta almost instantly, then videos, video series, entire websites, playable games and more.</p>

    <p>creepypasta is not limited to a single medium (obviously, since neither is the internet), so it follows that some of the most popular accompaniments to stories or even whole standalone creepypasta take the form of video. perhaps most popular for its video form is the creepypasta <span id="sumo">"suicide mouse,"</span> sometimes referred to as "suicide mouse.avi," whose text can almost be considered secondary to its video content; a blurb of backstory to enhance the viewing experience, but not the main event by any means. the video, despite its 9 minute length, is simple enough to be described in a single sentence: an black and white loop of mickey mouse walking the same city street, looking down, while creepy music and audio of screaming plays in the background. that's it. there are a couple cuts for variety or scares, like, for example, the video is flipped horizontally, or cuts close to a blurred version of mickey's face, but nothing substantial actually happens over the course of the 9 minutes.</p>
    <p>you can watch suicide mouse below, however be warned, while nothing graphic or violent is shown in the video, it features audio of screaming that may be disturbing to some, and overall is not suited for the easily creeped out.</p>

        <p>this, like much or perhaps all of creepypasta, is undeniably...kitschy. at least, it has very clear and somewhat silly-feeling intentions. (i hesitate to say, cringeworthy.) it wants to creep you out as much as possible and in doing so crosses a line into something else. gratuitous, cheap. ironic. such is, in my opinion, the essence of creepypasta. the word is almost antonymous with "professional." and part of that is due to its sheer accessibility. i mean, how much great versus shitty art are you going to be exposed to if you go to a reknowned museum versus if you browse a hundred random pages online? in terms of ratio, you're probably going to be exposed to a much higher volume of "bad" or "amateurish" art in the online space, because you don't have to <i>be</i> a professional or even good to put something there.</p>

    <p>that's not to say that creepypasta is defined by being <i>bad</i>. and even <i>that</i> isn't to say that in being bad, nobody likes it, because that's obviously not true. i like bad stuff all the time. everyone does. bad creepypasta is funny as fuck. are you telling me you could read "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ihadastroke/comments/9ujt76/the_infamous_man_door_hand_hook_car_door_legend/">man door hand hook car door</a>" or "<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/9StMuWF4MvQ?si=sUTaTf6giGS29e4s">WHO WAS PHONE</a>" and not smile even a little bit.</p>
